\input{./src-tex/preface-to-second-edition-2012.tex}

\chapter{Note}
Please be aware that the authors' monastic titles when the
original essays were written have been kept (e.g. `Sāmanera' or `Tan').
You will see in the short summaries added after each essay, which
explain what has happened since then, that almost all of them are now
senior monks whom we would usually honour by calling them `Ajahns',
teachers.
