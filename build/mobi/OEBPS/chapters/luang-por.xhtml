<p>You were a fountain of cool stream water<br />
in the square of a dusty town,<br />
and you were the source of that stream<br />
on a high unseen peak.<br />
You were, Luang Por, that mountain itself,<br />
unmoved but variously seen.</p>

<p>Luang Por, you were never one person,<br />
you were always the same.<br />
You were the child laughing<br />
at the Emperor’s new clothes,<br />
and ours.<br />
You were a demand to be awake,<br />
the mirror of our faults, ruthlessly kind.</p>

<p>Luang Por, you were the essence of our texts,<br />
the leader of our practice,<br />
the proof of its results.<br />
You were a blazing bonfire<br />
on a windy bone-chilled night,<br />
how we miss you!</p>

<p>Luang Por, you were the sturdy stone bridge<br />
we had dreamed of.<br />
You were as at ease<br />
in the present<br />
as if it were your own ancestral land.</p>

<p>Luang Por, you were the bright full moon<br />
that we sometimes obscured with clouds.<br />
You were as kind as only you could be.<br />
You were hard as granite,<br />
as tough as nails,<br />
as soft as butter<br />
and as sharp as a razor.</p>

<p>Luang Por, you were a freshly dripping lotus<br />
in a world of plastic flowers.<br />
Not once did you lead us astray.<br />
You were a lighthouse for our flimsy rafts<br />
on the heaving sea.</p>

<p>Luang Por,<br />
you are beyond my words of praise<br />
and all description.<br />
Humbly I place my head beneath your feet.</p>

<p>– Buang</p>
